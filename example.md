# The Lagrangian

The mathematical formulation of the Standard Model of particle physics


The Standard Model of particle physics is a **quantum field theory**. 
Therefore, its <span style="color:#ac1944;">fundamental elements are quantum fields</span> and the excitations of these fields are *identified* as **particles**.
All information is encoded in a compact description‚Äîthe so-called ‚ÄòLagrangian‚Äô ( $\mathcal{L}$ ), which is an extremely compact notation.

In the physics classroom, however, it is very difficult to achieve a deep-level understanding because the required mathematics skills go far beyond high-school level. Hence, we will only treat the ultra-short Lagrangian as below:
$$
\mathcal{L} = \color{#9d6fa5}{ -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} } 
              + \color{#c90024}{ i\bar{\psi} {\mathcal{D}}\!\!\!\!/ \psi }
              + \mathrm{h.c.} 
              + \color{#296b4c}{ \psi_i y_{ij} \psi_j \phi }
              + \mathrm{h.c.} 
              + \color{#4d45cc}{ |\mathcal{D}_{\mu} \phi |{ }^2 }
              - \color{#fe7b26}{ V(\phi) }
$$

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-5 items-center justify-center">

<div class="col-span-2">

> - <span style="color: #9d6fa5"> $F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$: This term is the scalar product of the field strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ containing the mathematical encoding of all interaction particles except the Higgs boson. It contains the necessary formulation for these particles to even exist, and describes how they interact with each other. </span>
> - <span style="color: #c90024"> $i\bar{\psi} {\mathcal{D}}\!\!\!\!/ \psi$: This term describes how interaction particles interact with matter particles. The fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$ describe (anti)quarks and (anti)leptons. </span>
